S(1)                             User Commands                            S(1)



NAME
       s - jump around

SYNOPSIS
       s [-hlrt] [regex1 regex2 ... regexn]

AVAILABILITY
       bash, zsh

DESCRIPTION
       Tracks your most used hosts, based on 'frecency'(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frecency).

       After  a  short  learning  phase, s will take you to the most 'frecent'
       host that matches ALL of the regexes given on the command line, in
       order.

       For example, s foo bar would match foobar but not barfoo.

INSTALL
       OS X
              brew tap haosdent/s && brew install s
       Linux
              wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haosdent/s/master/s.sh
              add source path/to/s.sh to $HOME/.bashrc or $HOME/.zshrc

OPTIONS

       -h     show a brief help message

       -l     list only

       -r     match by rank only

       -t     match by recent access only

EXAMPLES
       s foo         ssh to most frecent host matching foo

       s foo bar     ssh to most frecent host matching foo, then bar

       s -r foo      ssh to highest ranked host matching foo

       s -t foo      ssh to most recently accessed host matching foo

       s -l foo      list all hosts matching foo (by frecency)

NOTES
   Installation:
       Put something like this in your $HOME/.bashrc or $HOME/.zshrc:

              . /path/to/s.sh

       ssh around for a while to build up the db.

       PROFIT!!

       Optionally:
              Set $_S_CMD to change the command name (default s).
              Set $_S_DATA to change the datafile (default $HOME/.s).
              Set $_S_NO_PROMPT_COMMAND to handle PROMPT_COMMAND/precmd  your-
              self.fc
              Set $_S_EXCLUDE_HOSTS to an array of directory trees to  exclude.
              Set $_S_OWNER to allow usage when in 'sudo -s' mode.
              (These  settings  should  go  in  .bashrc/.zshrc before the line
              added above.)
              Install   the   provided   man   page   z.1    somewhere    like
              /usr/local/man/man1.

   Aging:
       The rank of directories maintained by s undergoes aging based on a sim-
       ple formula. The rank of each entry is incremented  every  time  it  is
       accessed.  When the sum of ranks is over 9000, all ranks are multiplied
       by 0.99. Entries with a rank lower than 1 are forgotten.

   Frecency:
       Frecency is a portmanteau of 'recent' and 'frequency'. It is a weighted
       rank  that depends on how often and how recently something occurred. As
       far as I know, Mozilla came up with the term.

       To s, a host that has low ranking but has been  accessed  recently
       will  quickly  have  higher rank than a host accessed frequently a
       long time ago.

       Frecency is determined at runtime.

   Common:
       When multiple hosts match all queries, and they all have a common
       prefix, s will ssh to the shortest matching directory, without regard to
       priority.  This has been in effect, if  undocumented,  for  quite  some
       time, but should probably be configurable or reconsidered.

   Tab Completion:
       s  supports tab completion. After any number of arguments, press TAB to
       complete on directories that match each argument. Due to limitations of
       the  completion  implementations,  only  the last argument will be com-
       pleted in the shell.

       Internally, s decides you've requested a completion if the  last  argu-
       ment  passed  is  an  absolute  path to an host.

ENVIRONMENT
       A function _s() is defined.

       The contents of the variable $_S_CMD is aliased to _s 2>&1. If not set,
       $_S_CMD defaults to s.

       The  environment  variable $_S_DATA can be used to control the datafile
       location. If it is not defined, the location defaults to $HOME/.s.

       In bash, s appends a command to the PROMPT_COMMAND environment variable
       to maintain its database. In zsh, s appends a function _s_preexec to the
       preexec_functions array.

       The environment variable $_S_NO_PROMPT_COMMAND can be set if  you  want
       to handle PROMPT_COMMAND or preexec yourself.

       The  environment  variable  $_S_EXCLUDE_HOSTS  can be set to an array of
       host to exclude from tracking.

       The  environment  variable  $_S_OWNER  can  be set to your username, to
       allow usage of s when your sudo enviroment keeps $HOME set.

FILES
       Data is stored in $HOME/.s. This  can  be  overridden  by  setting  the
       $_S_DATA  environment variable. When initialized, s will raise an error
       if this path is a directory, and not function correctly.

       A man page (s.1) is provided.
